# COMC-2747 DB App Dev - Mason Shafer

## Bookstore App

### Current Progress

- Customers form + logic
- Products form + logic
- Adding and removing from both forms
- Invoice form + logic
- Product Editing

### To-do

- Fixing repeated invoicebug
- dollar sign ('$') in product unit price string causes exception, need to find way to remove that!

### Personal notes

I'm frankly not super sure on how well I'm understanding this, I've followed through all the videos well enough but it still seems like I get lost in the code half the time, maybe over winter break I'll try to make a C# project on my own. 
If Mr. Endoza is reading through this please suggest any ideas for personal projects!
